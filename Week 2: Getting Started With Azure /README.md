Welcome to Week 2 of my Azure Learning Series!  
This week, I explored the fundamentals of Microsoft Azure and cloud computing.

## What I Covered:

- Created my Azure account  
- Understood Azure regions and availability zones  
- Learned about cloud service models:  
  - IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)  
  - PaaS (Platform as a Service)  
  - SaaS (Software as a Service)

## Key Takeaways:

- Azure has data centers around the globe to ensure high availability, reduce latency, and improve resilience.  
- Each cloud service model serves a different purpose:  
  - IaaS gives full infrastructure control  
  - PaaS simplifies application development  
  - SaaS provides fully managed solutions

## What's Next:

I’m excited to continue exploring more Azure services and deepen my cloud knowledge.

Let’s connect and grow together in the cloud space! 🚀
