# 🚀 Week 7 - Azure Series: Azure Networking Demo 🌐

Welcome to **Week 7** of our Azure Series! In this week’s module, we explore the **core networking services** in Microsoft Azure and walk through setting up a **secure and scalable network architecture**. Whether you're just getting started or looking to strengthen your skills in cloud networking, this guide offers a solid foundation in **Azure Networking** essentials.

## 🌐 What We Cover

In this session, we dive into the following **Azure Networking Components**:

### 1. Virtual Networks (VNet)

* Fundamental building block of your private network in Azure.
* Enables resources like VMs and databases to communicate securely.
* Supports IP address management, DNS configuration, and subnetting.

### 2. Subnets

* Subdivide your VNet into smaller, logical segments.
* Assign specific resources to subnets for better management and security.
* Used to control access via NSGs and route traffic effectively.

### 3. Network Security Groups (NSG)

* Acts as a virtual firewall for controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
* Attached to subnets or individual network interfaces.
* Rule-based configuration allowing granular access control.

### 4. Azure Firewall

* A fully stateful, scalable firewall as a service.
* Provides high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability.
* Used for logging, application rules, NAT rules, and network rules.

### 5. NAT Gateway

* Used to provide outbound internet connectivity to private subnets.
* Helps manage SNAT ports and improve performance for outbound connections.

### 6. Azure Bastion

* Secure RDP/SSH access to Azure VMs without exposing public IP addresses.
* Integrates directly into the Azure portal.
* Protects against port scanning and other threats.

## 🔐 Key Features Demonstrated

* Creating Virtual Networks and Subnets
* Implementing NSGs with custom inbound/outbound rules
* Configuring Azure Firewall and NAT rules
* Enabling Bastion for secure VM access
* Testing connectivity and validating secure access patterns

## 💡 Why Azure Networking Matters

**Networking is at the heart of cloud infrastructure.**
Without proper configuration, applications become vulnerable and underperform. Mastering Azure networking enables:

* Scalable deployments
* Cost-efficient architecture
* Enhanced security posture
* Better traffic management and monitoring

## 📸 Screenshots (Optional)

Include screenshots here (network topology, NSG rules, Bastion connection, etc.) to illustrate your demo setup.

## 🧪 Try It Yourself!

Here's a basic flow to replicate the demo:

1. Create a Resource Group
2. Create a Virtual Network with Subnet
3. Create and Associate a Network Security Group
4. Deploy a VM and Connect Using Bastion

(Commands can be added here optionally for hands-on steps.)

## 🔁 What's Next?

Stay tuned for:

* Load Balancing and Traffic Manager
* VPN Gateway and ExpressRoute
* Hybrid Networking Architecture
* Azure Monitoring for Networks
