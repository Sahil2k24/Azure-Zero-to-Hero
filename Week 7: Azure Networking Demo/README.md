# 🚀 Week 7 - Azure Series: Azure Networking Demo 🌐

Welcome to **Week 7** of our Azure Series! In this week’s module, we explore the **core networking services** in Microsoft Azure and walk through setting up a **secure and scalable network architecture**. Whether you're just getting started or looking to strengthen your skills in cloud networking, this guide offers a solid foundation in **Azure Networking** essentials.

---

## 🌐 What We Cover

In this session, we dive into the following **Azure Networking Components**:

### 1. **Virtual Networks (VNet)**
- Fundamental building block of your private network in Azure.
- Enables resources like VMs and databases to communicate securely.
- Supports IP address management, DNS configuration, and subnetting.

### 2. **Subnets**
- Subdivide your VNet into smaller, logical segments.
- Assign specific resources to subnets for better management and security.
- Used to control access via NSGs and route traffic effectively.

### 3. **Network Security Groups (NSG)**
- Acts as a virtual firewall for controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
- Attached to subnets or individual network interfaces.
- Rule-based configuration allowing granular access control.

### 4. **Azure Firewall**
- A fully stateful, scalable firewall as a service.
- Provides high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability.
- Used for logging, application rules, NAT rules, and network rules.

### 5. **NAT Gateway**
- Used to provide outbound internet connectivity to private subnets.
- Helps manage SNAT ports and improve performance for outbound connections.

### 6. **Azure Bastion**
- Secure RDP/SSH access to Azure VMs without exposing public IP addresses.
- Integrates directly into the Azure portal.
- Protects against port scanning and other threats.

## 🔐 Key Features Demonstrated

- 🔧 Creating Virtual Networks and Subnets
- 🔐 Implementing NSGs with custom inbound/outbound rules
- 🔥 Configuring Azure Firewall and NAT rules
- 🛡️ Enabling Bastion for secure VM access
- 📶 Testing connectivity and validating secure access patterns

## 💡 Why Azure Networking Matters

> **Networking is at the heart of cloud infrastructure.** Without proper configuration, applications become vulnerable and underperform. Mastering Azure networking enables:
- **Scalable deployments**
- **Cost-efficient architecture**
- **Enhanced security posture**
- **Better traffic management and monitoring**

## 🧪 Try It Yourself!

Here's a basic flow to replicate the demo:

1. **Create a Resource Group**
   ```bash
   az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location eastus
````

2. **Create a Virtual Network with Subnet**

   ```bash
   az network vnet create \
     --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
     --name MyVNet \
     --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \
     --subnet-name MySubnet \
     --subnet-prefix 10.0.1.0/24
   ```

3. **Create and Associate a Network Security Group**

   ```bash
   az network nsg create \
     --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
     --name MyNSG
   ```

4. **Deploy a VM and Connect Using Bastion**

   * Follow Azure portal to deploy Bastion service
   * Connect to VM via Bastion without public IP
